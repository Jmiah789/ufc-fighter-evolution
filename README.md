# What is the cause of the gender pay gap in the UFC?

# Motivation
As an avid mixed martial arts fan, I have always enjoyed staying informed about fighters and the fighting industry. Knowing that fighter pay is a controversial and trending topic, I decided to investigate the difference in pay between male fighters and female fighters.

# Data Questions
How significant is the pay gap between men and womne in the UFC?
What are key factors that contribute to salary?
Can the gender pay gap in the UFC be attributed to these factors? If not, is that indicative of sexism on the part of the UFC?

# Findings

There is clearly a wage gap between men and women, which is demonstrated by the data. 
Is the gap due to sexism on the part of the UFC or fans?
That is more difficult to answer. Other factors of varying relevance seem to favor men, such as weight, popularity among fans, and historical longevity. Though even accounting for these factors, womenâ€™s average pay does seem to be at least partially below where it should be.

# Known Issues and Challenges
Due to time constraints, I was not able to scrape and join all data that I wanted to, though I plan to do so at a time in the future. Specifically, UFC event data including dates to match number of fights in a year, event attendance, pay per views, and male vs female headlining fights would help in more definitively determining why there is a pay gap.
